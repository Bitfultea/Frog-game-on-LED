# Frog-game-on-LED
 The program is a version of Frogger – see www.happyhopper.org for a web-based version of Frogger if you are
unfamiliar with the game.

The AVR ATmega324A microcontroller runs the program and receives input from a number of sources and outputs a 
display to an LED display board, with additional information being output to a serial terminal and, to be implemented 
as part of this project, a seven segment display and other LEDs.

the frog can only move in one direction (forward / up) and the game ends immediately when a frog “dies”
